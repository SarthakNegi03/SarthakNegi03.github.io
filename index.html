      On January 17 1994, at around approximately 4:30 AM, an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 hit Los Angeles. The earthquake was strong enough to wake up the residents living in the city, who came out of their houses to see what had happened.
      <p>
        To their surprise, the sky was glimmering with stars, along with what appeared to be a giant mysterious "cloud". The cloud looked so peculiar, that the residents started calling 911 to report the mysterious cloud. The cloud turned out to be "The Milky Way", which had long been concealed behind the glimmering city lights.

      <h1>What is Light Pollution?</h1>
      <p> We all have been familiarised with air, water, and land pollution. However, what most of fail to acknowledge is light pollution. The excessive and inappropriate use of artificial lights inevitably leads to a phenomenon known as light pollution. <p>
          Interior ligthing, along with building exterior lighting, advertising, and brightly lit venues have a major contribution towards light pollution. Street lights are also a prime contributor towards the inefficient use of artificial lights.<p> Most of the light produced by artificial lighting gets slipped into the sky, rather than the area that people want to illuminate. This excessive brightness is responsible for a phenomenon called light glare, which can lead to visual discomfort
            <p>
              For most of human history, untill the past 2 centuries, our ancenstors have experienced a night sky overflowing with stars and galaxies. With the advent of the light bulb and the industrial revolution, this sight has been snatched from us. The sky that inspired millenniums of art, science, philosophy; the sky that our ancestors sat upon is rapidly becomming unknown to the newer generations. Experiencing the night sky provides perspective, inspiration, and leads us to reflect on our humanity and place in the universe. The history of scientific discovery and even human curiosity itself is indebted to the natural night sky.

      <h1> Impact of light pollution</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Human Health</b>
        <br>
        Light pollution has had a significant impact on not just the environment, but humans as well. Historians have argued and have recently come to believe that humans are natural biphasic sleepers. This means that humans naturally slept in two distinct phases, bridged by an intervening period of wakefulness of approximately one hour. The brain exhibits high levels of the pituitary hormone prolactin during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.

        <p>
          However, due to the advent of the industrial revolution, and the modern use of electric lighting that most modern humans do not practice interrupted sleep, which is a concern. Members of modern industrialised societies, with later evening hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice interrupted sleep, and this is believed to be one of the causes behind the rising stress levels in humans over the past century. <p>
            Our bodies produce the hormone melatonin in response to the natural circadian rhythm. Melatonin helps keep us healthy. It has antioxidant properties, induces sleep, boosts the immune system, lowers cholesterol, and helps the functioning of the thyroid, pancreas, ovaries, testes and adrenal glands. Nighttime exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin production.

      <b>Ecosystems</b>
      <br>
      Light pollution posses a serious threat to nocturnal species, altering their natural physiology. It can have an impact on the way they navigate, alter competitive interactions, change predator-prey relations, and cause physiological harm. One major way light pollution impacrs the nocturnal creatures is by reorienting their circadian rhythm.
      <p>

        Noctural plants can be severly impacted by light pollution. These plants rely on nocturnal pollinators such as moths to pollinate. However, these moths are impacted by nighttlight and roam around tall streetlights, leaving nocturnal plants without any insect to pollinate them. Since no replacement nocturnal pollinator is available, the number of nocturnal plants decline over time, therefore changing the local ecology.

        <b>Astronomy</b>
        <br>
        Astronomy is really sensitive to light pollution. The night sky visible from the city is not at all ideal to explore and conduct research through telescopes. Therefore, laboratories with telescopes have to be increasingly be built in remote areas with minimal to no light pollution, as light pollution increases sky glow, which reduces the visibility of stars and galaxy clusters visible in the night sky. This makes it really inefficient as it is far away from human resources, and therefore requries an additional cost for supplies to be transported to the laboratory.
        <p>
          Some astronomers use light pollution reduction (LPR) filters to filter out the light pollution in polluted skies to reduce the impact of sky glow, and therefore making research easier. These LPR filters reduce the impact of light pollution, however they don't completely eliminate it, and are therefore not a good solution to light pollution's impact on astronomy research.

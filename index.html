      On January 17 1994, at around approximately 4:30 AM, an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 hit Los Angeles. The earthquake was strong enough to wake up the residents living in the city, who came out of their houses to see what had happened.
      <p>
        To their surprise, the sky was glimmering with stars, along with what appeared to be a giant mysterious "cloud". The cloud looked so peculiar, that the residents started calling 911 to report the mysterious cloud. The cloud turned out to be "The Milky Way", which had long been concealed behind the glimmering city lights.

      <h1>What is Light Pollution?</h1>
      <p> We all have been familiarised with air, water, and land pollution. However, what most of fail to acknowledge is light pollution. The excessive and inappropriate use of artificial lights inevitably leads to a phenomenon known as light pollution. <p>
          Interior ligthing, along with building exterior lighting, advertising, and brightly lit venues have a major contribution towards light pollution. Street lights are also a prime contributor towards the inefficient use of artificial lights.<p> Most of the light produced by artificial lighting gets slipped into the sky, rather than the area that people want to illuminate. This excessive brightness is responsible for a phenomenon called light glare, which can lead to visual discomfort
            <p>
              For most of human history, untill the past 2 centuries, our ancenstors have experienced a night sky overflowing with stars and galaxies. With the advent of the light bulb and the industrial revolution, this sight has been snatched from us. The sky that inspired millenniums of art, science, philosophy; the sky that our ancestors sat upon is rapidly becomming unknown to the newer generations. Experiencing the night sky provides perspective, inspiration, and leads us to reflect on our humanity and place in the universe. The history of scientific discovery and even human curiosity itself is indebted to the natural night sky.

      <h1> Impact of light pollution</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Human Health</b>
        <br>
        Light pollution has had a significant impact on not just the environment, but humans as well. Historians have argued and have recently come to believe that humans are natural biphasic sleepers. This means that humans naturally slept in two distinct phases, bridged by an intervening period of wakefulness of approximately one hour. The brain exhibits high levels of the pituitary hormone prolactin during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.

        <p>
          However, due to the advent of the industrial revolution, and the modern use of electric lighting that most modern humans do not practice interrupted sleep, which is a concern. Members of modern industrialised societies, with later evening hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice interrupted sleep, and this is believed to be one of the causes behind the rising stress levels in humans over the past century. <p>
            Our bodies produce the hormone melatonin in response to the natural circadian rhythm. Melatonin helps keep us healthy. It has antioxidant properties, induces sleep, boosts the immune system, lowers cholesterol, and helps the functioning of the thyroid, pancreas, ovaries, testes and adrenal glands. Nighttime exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin production.

      <b>Ecosystems</b>
      <br>
      Light pollution posses a serious threat to nocturnal species, altering their natural physiology. It can have an impact on the way they navigate, alter competitive interactions, change predator-prey relations, and cause physiological harm. One major way light pollution impacrs the nocturnal creatures is by reorienting their circadian rhythm.
      <p>

        Noctural plants can be severly impacted by light pollution. These plants rely on nocturnal pollinators such as moths to pollinate. However, these moths are impacted by nighttlight and roam around tall streetlights, leaving nocturnal plants without any insect to pollinate them. Since no replacement nocturnal pollinator is available, the number of nocturnal plants decline over time, therefore changing the local ecology.

        <b>Astronomy</b>
        <br>
        Astronomy is really sensitive to light pollution. The night sky visible from the city is not at all ideal to explore and conduct research through telescopes. Therefore, laboratories with telescopes have to be increasingly be built in remote areas with minimal to no light pollution, as light pollution increases sky glow, which reduces the visibility of stars and galaxy clusters visible in the night sky. This makes it really inefficient as it is far away from human resources, and therefore requries an additional cost for supplies to be transported to the laboratory.
        <p>
          Some astronomers use light pollution reduction (LPR) filters to filter out the light pollution in polluted skies to reduce the impact of sky glow, and therefore making research easier. These LPR filters reduce the impact of light pollution, however they don't completely eliminate it, and are therefore not a good solution to light pollution's impact on astronomy research.

            <h2> Improving Light Fixtures</h2>
            <img src="https://www.blancocountynightsky.org/img/cutoff.jpg" width="100%" alt="a better designed street lamp that reduces light pollution" /><i style="font-size: 10px; line-height: 20%;" />A flat-lens cobra luminaire, which is a full-cutoff fixture, is very effective in reducing light pollution. It ensures that light is directed only below the horizontal, which means less light is wasted through directing it outwards and upwards. Image by blancocountynightsky</i>
            <p>
              Full cutoff light fixtures first became avaialble in 1959. These cutoff light fixtures reduce the amount of light going up, and instead focusses it down where it is intended to be focused. This reduces sky glow as light does not escape into the sky. Since these were introduced a bit late, there is not enough variety in their design and they are often not aesthetically pleasing to look at. However, as they become more poppular, their designs have started to become better, and as the demand for them will grow, their will surely be better innovations regarding their design.
              <P>
                Using full cutoff light fixtures can allow lower wattage lamps to be used, in most cases providing a better effect, since they are carefully controlled and placed. This can reduce the energy consumption, and therefore also contribute towards reducing greenhouse emissions.

            <h2>Better Light Planning</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/LED_Droplight.JPG" width="100%" alt="an efficient use of lighting in office space" /> <i style="font-size: 10px; line-height: 20%;">This kind of LED droplight could reduce unnecessary light pollution in building interiors. Image by RitoJiang</i>
            <p>
              Light pollution can also be reduced by better planning of lighting. By cutting off unnecessary outdoor lighting, light pollution can be reduced significantly. Another such example include turning off stadiums and other sports facilities when not in use, and turning them on only when someone is in them.
              <p>
                The Deputy Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, commisioned a report which details a plan that is set to be implemented througout the entire country, describing schemes that explain better planning for lighting, especially in the countryside, with a major focus on preserving the environment. This is one example of how the government can take steps to ensure that the natural light sky can be regained by the people.

            <h2>Appropriate Light Sources</h2>
            <img src="https://www.darksky.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Kelvin_Temperature_Chart.svg_.png" width="100%" alt="a chart showing temperature of different types of light" />
            <i style=" font-size: 10px;"> The bluer the light, the more it should be avoided after the dark</i>
            <p>
              The glare provided by poorly shielded outdoor lighting is detrimental to human health, and the reduction in contrast can lead to a decreased vision. Poorly chosen light sources can contribute towards unnecessary light pollution and light waste. Laboratories dependant on a non-polluted light sky often advice nearby residents to use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium indium phosphide LEDs as they are not as polluting as other sources.
              <p>
                It is also adviced not to use blue-light at night as it can desrupt our natural sleep cycle, and cooler colours such as yellow are recommended over blue-light.

      On January 17 1994, at around approximately 4:30 AM, an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 hit Los Angeles. The earthquake was strong enough to wake up the residents living in the city, who came out of their houses to see what had happened.
      <p>
        To their surprise, the sky was glimmering with stars, along with what appeared to be a giant mysterious "cloud". The cloud looked so peculiar, that the residents started calling 911 to report the mysterious cloud. The cloud turned out to be "The Milky Way", which had long been concealed behind the glimmering city lights.

      <h1>What is Light Pollution?</h1>
      <p> We all have been familiarised with air, water, and land pollution. However, what most of fail to acknowledge is light pollution. The excessive and inappropriate use of artificial lights inevitably leads to a phenomenon known as light pollution. <p>
          Interior ligthing, along with building exterior lighting, advertising, and brightly lit venues have a major contribution towards light pollution. Street lights are also a prime contributor towards the inefficient use of artificial lights.<p> Most of the light produced by artificial lighting gets slipped into the sky, rather than the area that people want to illuminate. This excessive brightness is responsible for a phenomenon called light glare, which can lead to visual discomfort
            <p>
              For most of human history, untill the past 2 centuries, our ancenstors have experienced a night sky overflowing with stars and galaxies. With the advent of the light bulb and the industrial revolution, this sight has been snatched from us. The sky that inspired millenniums of art, science, philosophy; the sky that our ancestors sat upon is rapidly becomming unknown to the newer generations. Experiencing the night sky provides perspective, inspiration, and leads us to reflect on our humanity and place in the universe. The history of scientific discovery and even human curiosity itself is indebted to the natural night sky.

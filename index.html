        On January 17 1994, at around approximately 4:30 AM, an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 hit Los Angeles. The earthquake was strong 
enough to wake up the residents living in the city, who came out of their houses to see what had happened.
        <p>
        To their surprise, the sky was glimmering with stars, along with  what appeared to be a giant mysterious "cloud". The cloud
 looked so peculiar, that the residents started calling 911 to report the mysterious cloud. The cloud turned out to be "The Milky Way", 
which had long been concealed behind the glimmering city lights.
